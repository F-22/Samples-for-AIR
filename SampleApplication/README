========================================================================
Debug/Run with FlashBuilder 4.5

  Some included APIs will *NOT* execute in Desktop Application Flash builder debug profiles. Therefore, Import the Sample Application Project into Flashbuilder, then Debug as Mobile Application, with target platform set to BlackBerry Tablet OS.
  
  Select SampleAirApplication and choose Run As\Mobile Application (or Debug As) and set the following properties:
  
  - Project: SampleAirApplication
  - Application File: src/SampleApplication
  - Target Platform: BlackBerry Tablet OS
  - Launch Method: On device.
  
  When configuring BlackBerry Table test device profile USB is preferred as WiFi reception can cause the connection to fail.
  
  The USB port starts with 169.254.*.* If you are using Tablet OS 1.0.7 and above the ip address will be 169.254.0.1 and you can set the debug host to 169.254.0.2 if you like to make sure it uses the right one. 
  
  
  NOTE: Enable development mode on your BlackBerry Playbook, Playbook Options\Security\Development Mode\Use development mode set to on.
