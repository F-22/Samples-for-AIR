CSS Sample

========================================================================
Sample Description.

The CSS Sample app demonstrates how to use CSS to manipulate objects in your application without writing ActionScript Code.
Using CSS to set properties on objects makes it easy to create applications that will make run on multiple device configurations.
This sample project also contains a ant build script to show you how to optimize your CSS in order to reduce startup time.
Because String manipulation is slow in ActionScript, parsing the CSS file at runtime can cause long startup times.
Pre-parsing the CSS at build time will drastically reduce the startup time as the CSS no longer needs to be parsed.

You will learn:
 - How to create a CSS file.
 - How to create a custom component.
 - How to alter objects using CSS.
 - How to alter nested objects using CSS.
 - How to customize text using CSS.
 - How to pre-parse CSS.
