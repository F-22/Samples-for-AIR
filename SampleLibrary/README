Sample Library

The Samples for AIR open source project, offers sample APIs written using Blackberry Tablet OS SDK for Adobe AIR. APIs include common utilities and UI elements such as animated screen transitions, navigation menu, media component, search field, and download manager. A fully functional example application that demonstrates how to use the provided APIs is also provided.

Navigation menu
-------------------
A customizable navigation bar offers optional elements, such as tabbed browsing and search input field. Buttons that launch user options, help and return to home are also available. Clicking the help icon launches the browser to supplied URL.

Search field
-------------------
A customizable search field allows users to type search text that filters words that match characters as they type.

Download Manager
-------------------
The download manager is a utility that maintains a queue of tasks consisting of the source URL, destination file path and relevant meta-data. Tasks can be added, paused, resumed and removed from the persisted download manager queue. The UI must implement the controls to display pause/resume, stop, remove management controls and show status of downloads.

Clients are notified of the following state changes: pending, initializing, complete and failed. Active download progress is provided so clients may update the UI with the number of kb/MB downloaded.

The download manager will pause or resume downloads if events of the following nature are detected:

    WIFI reception loss and regain,
    File system space  full and available, or
    HTTP and FILE IO errors.

Media Playbar
-------------------
A music player example shows how to invoke stop, play/pause and use volume media controls.

Screen animations
-------------------
A screen transition utility takes source and destination screens and horizontally slides screens in and out of view.

Cache
-------------------
Written for applications that download large quantities of images and keep them for extended periods of time, the file system assisted image cache API takes a URL and returns an image from the cache or remote server.

Scrolling Marquee field
-------------------
A scrolling marquee field scrolls text from left to right. This is useful to fit long text strings in small spaces.

Back button
-------------------
The UI back button has a customized skin.
